### Note:
Github is not a place to test your code. We strongly recommend you run your finished programs on your local machine/laptop first to test if they are working correctly, using the instructions you received in the lab sessions and then copy the finished code to github. Do not exceed 15 commits or your grades will be penalized.

If your code did not pass, revise your code and submit(commit) your changes again.

Make sure you have your final submission in before the deadline has passed. You will not be able to submit changes after the deadline has passed.

For any questions, please reach out to Dr. Katy Tarrit (katytm7@hawaii.edu) AND Aditi Jaiswal (ajaiswal@hawaii.edu)
